Secrets App is a community secret sharing application, where one can login/register and post a secret or confession anonymously.
The front end has been implemented using CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and templating engine like EJS.
This is also a full-fledged Node.js backed website, which helps to persist user data using a local Mongoose database connected to our local server, which in turn is set up using Node.js and Express.
To ensure utmost security and privacy of the user, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js namely, "Passport" has been used. This also permits user authentication via Google, with the help of OAuth2.0 strategy, which is an open standard for token based authorization.
